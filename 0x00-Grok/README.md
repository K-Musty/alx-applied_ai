### About

- Grok, an advanced AI chatbot developed by xAI, a company founded by Elon Musk, was launched in November 2023. Grok provides insightful and humorous responses using xAI’s state-of-the-art large language model. Grok’s multimodal capabilities, processing text and visual information like documents, diagrams, and photographs, make it versatile for data analysis, content creation, and business automation.

Previously, access to this feature was restricted to premium X (formerly Twitter) subscribers. However, recently, it has been made available to all users, expanding its accessibility and enabling us to experience it at no cost.


### Get Started

- To get started you need a x.com (formerly Twitter) account. So if you don't already have one, click the below link and signup.

*https://x.com/i/grok

- Next, on the left side navigation you can see a link to "Grok". Grok is similar to any AI chat bot such as ChatGPT and very easy to use. However, the free version has limitations.

- One of the most advantageous features of Grok is its ability to provide access to the most recent information. As demonstrated in the above example, you can request the most recent news, and it will respond with sources to relevant web pages and tweets.

- Another application of this tool is to provide it with an image or a PDF (any supported file that contains textual or visual data) and pose questions. As illustrated below, I have uploaded a 3D chart, and it has successfully provided a detailed explanation.

#### Fun mode

- Fun Mode infuses humor, personality, and sometimes sarcasm into the AI chatbot’s responses, transforming them from dull to lively and engaging, setting them apart from other AI chatbots.

#### Groq API (Optional)

- xAI announced the release of their new Groq API and has initiated a public beta program that will continue until the end of 2024. During this period, all users will receive a complimentary allocation of $25 in API credits per month!!

- So head over to (https://console.x.ai) and sinup for an account.

#### Msty

- Next we need a Chat Client. There are a lot out there but we will use Msty. Visit the below link and download for your oprating system.

- On the next page, set the Model Provider to be "Open AI Compatible" if you don't see Groq listed and then give it any name.
